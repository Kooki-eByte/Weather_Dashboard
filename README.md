# Weather_Dashboard

A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS

## How it works

In the web application you will only need to put in a city of your choice. If it does not exist or is spelled wrong then nothing will happen.

- You can type the **city name** in the search bar and it will give you the **current time/weather** and a **5-day forecast for it**

- The city you searched will then be put underneath as a **previous search section** (_goes up to 10_).

  - On here you can _click_ any of the previous cities to get the weather for it

- When you refresh or click back on this page it will automatically give you the weather for the previous city you looked up.
